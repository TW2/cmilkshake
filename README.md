<p>Allow to compare two Advanced Sub Station files (ASS files) and watch video to see changes in real time. 
  <br />Old version requires Java 7 or higher and VLC 2.0.x or its libraries on your system in order to launch the software. This project uses <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a> through <a href="http://caprica.github.com/vlcj/">VLCj</a>, <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a> and <a href="http://www.xuggle.com/">Xuggle</a> (for the future). 
  <br />Tested on Windows 7 64bits (JRE7 32 bits) and Ubuntu 12.10 64bits (OpenJDK 7 runtime).
  
  <br />New version still in development requires GraalVM only. For the moment, only two buttons works (Quit and Open). You cans open two ASS on same folder. The next things are that it opens with an automatic sort mode and an automatic sentence comparison. No executable is provided.
