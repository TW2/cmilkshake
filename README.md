<p>This tool allows yourself to compare two Advanced Sub Station files (ASS files) and watch video to see changes 
in real time. You must have Java 7 or higher and VLC 2.0.x or its libraries on your system in order to launch the 
software. This project uses <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a> through 
<a href="http://caprica.github.com/vlcj/">VLCj</a>, <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a> 
and <a href="http://www.xuggle.com/">Xuggle</a> (for the future). Tested on Windows 7 64bits (JRE7 32 bits) and 
Ubuntu 12.10 64bits (OpenJDK 7 runtime).</p>
