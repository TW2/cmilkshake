==========

<p>Allow to compare two Advanced Sub Station files (ASS files) and watch video to see changes in real time. 
  <br />Old version requires Java 7 or higher and VLC 2.0.x or its libraries on your system in order to launch the software. This project uses <a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VLC</a> through <a href="http://caprica.github.com/vlcj/">VLCj</a>, <a href="http://www.jfree.org/jfreechart/">JFreeChart</a> and <a href="http://www.xuggle.com/">Xuggle</a> (for the future). 
  <br />Tested on Windows 7 64bits (JRE7 32 bits) and Ubuntu 12.10 64bits (OpenJDK 7 runtime).
  
  <br />New version still in development requires GraalVM only. No executable is provided.
